**ANALYSING MEMES FOR BRAND CULTURAL RELEVANCE** 

**overall campaign success probability: 17.5%** which means: memes are a **high-risk cultural instrument**, not a default growth lever.

memes reward:

* tone-genre alignment  
* restraint  
* cultural fluency

memes punish:

* visibility without belonging  
* institutional chaos  
* brands trying to cosplay personality

### **what the data says**

* strongest alignment with shitpost \+ brand\_parody  
* irony survives institutionalization

### **strategy**

**use memes — but quietly**

* default tone: ironic / minimal  
* genres: shitpost, parody, selective nostalgia  
* platforms: instagram (reach), tiktok (breakouts)  
* keep campaign framing invisible

* default tone: ironic  
* genres: parody, light political, niche insider memes  
* platforms: twitter, reddit first → instagram later
