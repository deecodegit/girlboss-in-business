### 1\. material conditions (base reality)

what people have, not what they say

business translation

* determines price tolerance  
* determines packaging size (sachets vs subscriptions)

### 4\. identity anchors

what people refuse to let go of  
look at:

### 5\. semiotics (the visual & verbal code)

what things mean, not what they are  
decode:

### 7\. generational tension

where culture is breaking or mutating  
track:

* what gen z rejects from millennials
