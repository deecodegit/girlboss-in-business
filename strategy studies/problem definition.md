For each question, force yourself to answer in this format:

1. **What decision is being made?**  
2. **What’s the real problem (not symptom)?**  
3. **What metric decides this?**  
4. **What’s the risk of being wrong?**

# **HARD (Decision-Grade Thinking)**

*Goal: Think in trade-offs, not metrics*

18. A feature improves retention but increases operational cost.

29. Data shows rural customers are loss-making.  
    What non-data factors must be considered?

30. A KPI improves across the board.  
    Why might you still not trust it?

31. You’re told “analytics should support the decision already made.”
